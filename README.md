This is a short, but simple demonstration of a pomodoro timer app made in .NET MAUI. Not all features are implemented, but only the important ones. 

As soon as you press 'START', the program will pick up what number you wrote in the 'Study', 'Short Break', and 'Long Break' entries and create a timer. It will then display a popup when the timer has run out of time.

NOTE: This demonstration doesn't include an 'alarm' or a notification of sorts, so the app is only limited to popups. This demonstration also doesn't run as a background app, so you'll have to run it, while also keeping your phone unlocked (Which is unintuitive, I know).
