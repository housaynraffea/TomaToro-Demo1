# TomaToro
This is a short, but simple demonstration of a pomodoro timer app made in .NET MAUI. Not all features are implemented, but only the important ones. 

As soon as you press 'START', the program will pick up what number you wrote in the 'Study', 'Short Break', and 'Long Break' entries and create a timer. It will then display a popup when the timer has run out of time.

NOTE: the 'Auto-start' features are commented. This was a simple case of my own overcomplifications and overscoping leading to these features being cut from the demonstration. However, if you'd like an extra challenge, you can add them in yourself!
NOTE: Parsing hasn't been implemented yet (which isn't good ...), but will probably not be considered in the future since this is intended to be a simple demonstration. As always, you can improve upon the code if you'd like to.
