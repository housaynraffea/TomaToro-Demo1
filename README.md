# TomaToro
This is a short, but simple demonstration of a pomodoro timer app made in .NET MAUI. Not all features are implemented, but only the important ones. Note that the 'Auto-start' features are commented. This was a simple case of my own overcomplifications and overscoping, so they eventually were cut from the demonstration. If you'd like, you can add them yourself if you want to.
