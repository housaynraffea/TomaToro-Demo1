This is a short, but simple demonstration of a pomodoro timer app made in .NET MAUI. Not all features are implemented, but only the important ones. 

As soon as you press 'START', the program will pick up what number you wrote in the 'Study', 'Short Break', and 'Long Break' entries and create a timer. It will then display a popup when the timer has run out of time.

NOTE: This demonstration doesn't include an 'alarm' or a notification of sorts, so the app is only limited to popups. Meaning you can actually RUN it in the background, you'll just not know if the timer has finished or not.

NOTE: the 'Auto-start' features are commented. This was a simple case of my own overcomplifications and overscoping leading to these features being cut from the demonstration. However, if you'd like an extra challenge, you can add them in yourself!
